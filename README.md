# 🔐 Security Audits Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity audit portfolio! This repository showcases my hands-on practice and understanding of security audits, risk assessments, and compliance frameworks. It includes documentation, assessments, and controls aligned with real-world scenarios.

## 📁 Contents

- `botium-toys-audit/`: A mock audit for Botium Toys, focusing on risk assessment, scope, goals, and compliance with best practices and controls.
- `study-guides/`: Supplementary study materials created alongside coursework and self-study to strengthen my understanding of security domains, frameworks, and tools.

## ✅ Completed Audits

### 📦 Botium Toys Audit

**Scenario**: Botium Toys is a toy manufacturer that relies on both digital and physical systems to run its operations. The organization required an internal audit to evaluate risks, define goals, and assess compliance with controls such as physical access, network security, and risk management processes.

**Deliverables**:
- [Scope, Goals, and Risk Assessment Report](./botium-toys-audit/Botium%20Toys_%20Scope,%20goals,%20and%20risk%20assessment%20report.pdf)
- [Controls and Compliance Checklist](./botium-toys-audit/Controls%20and%20compliance%20checklist.pdf)
- Visuals for identified controls and areas of concern

**Key Areas Evaluated**:
- Physical security controls (access, surveillance)
- Risk classification of systems
- Compliance alignment with standard frameworks (NIST, ISO 27001)

## 📚 Why This Repo?

As part of my journey through the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate** and formal coursework at Indiana Tech, I’m building this mini portfolio to show my understanding of core security practices — especially risk management, assessment, compliance, and technical/administrative controls.

More audits and study references will be added as I progress.

## 🚀 Upcoming Additions

- Additional mock audits from coursework or practice scenarios
- Summary documentation for frameworks (NIST CSF, ISO/IEC 27001, HIPAA, etc.)
- Custom flowcharts and risk visuals created in draw.io
